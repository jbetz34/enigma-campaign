# Week 2
#### Objective:
I want to create a fun challenge for users to solve before they get into this puzzle. Encrypting the puzzle clues would be a great way to encourage participants to solve the puzzles in order and make it seem like every step is relevent. Solving the puzzles one at a time will hopefully make the final product easier to understand. 
In this puzzle I want to intoduce the concept of a 'reflector', but the burden of explanation is on me. Once the concept is properly explained, I am concerned it is too easy. I think it would be good to keep the plugboard concept in this puzzle. Explain how the flow of letters moves from the plugboard to the reflector, back to the plugboard. You dont have to be crazy accurate about the exact workings of the machine. 

#### Flow of data:
The letters will move from the keyboard input to the plugboard, then the output of the plugboard into the reflector input, then the output of the reflector into the input of the plugboard once more and finaly the output of the plugboard goes to the lightboard

#### Images: 
- Should have image of letter flow from keyboard to lightboard
- Should have image of reflector, showing wirings and mappings as necessary

#### Explanation: 
Maybe leave out the concept of the gears completely? Or mostly. The clue should be that Link was playing around with the gears on the machine. *how do I indicate that the gears started making an impact without confusing the audience?* He discovered that most of the gears in the machine can be removed, when he does thatthe output of the machine behaves predictably. Note that the static rotor acts as a plugboard with wires connecting all 13 pairs of letters. *show diagram here* 
Here's a different view of how the letters map to each other *show another diagram here*
The reflector is part of a larger letter flow in which the plugboard is the start and the end of that flow. *show flow diagram*
