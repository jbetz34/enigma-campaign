I DISCOVERED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MACHINE WE FOUND
THE PLUGBOARD IS NOT THE ONLY PART OF THE MACHINE THAT PERFORMS ENCRYPTION
I WAS PLAYING AROUND WITH THE ROTORS AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THEY WORK
THERE ARE THREE ROTORS THAT CAN BE FREELY ADDED OR REMOVED FROM THE MACHINE AND ONE STATIC ROTOR THAT CANNOT BE REMOVED
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THE STATIC ROTOR ACTS EXACTLY LIKE THE PLUGBOARD BUT USES ALL TWENTY SIX LETTERS
THE ROTOR HAS TWENTY SIX NUMBERED COGS THAT ALIGN WITH TWENTY SIX LETTERS INSCRIBED ON THE ROTOR
THE NUMBER ON THE COGS INCREASE BY ONE AS YOU GO AROUND THE ROTOR CLOCKWISE BUT THE CORRESPONDING LETTERS ARE NOT IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER
THE FIRST SIX LETTERS IN ORDER ARE ETUSAY
WHEN I TRY TO TYPE THE LETTER A THE LIGHTBOARD ILLUMINATES THE LETTER E 
WHEN I TRY TO TYPE THE LETTER E THE LIGHTBOARD ILLUMINATES THE LETTER A
THE OUTPUT OF THE PLUGBOARD IS FED INTO THE STATIC ROTOR AS AN INPUT 
THEN THE OUTPUT FROM THE STATIC ROTOR IS FED BACK INTO THE PLUGBOARD AGAIN AS INPUT
I HAVE ATTACHED A DRAWING OF HOW IT WORKS BELOW
THE OUTPUT FROM THE SECOND PASS THROUGH THE PLUGBOARD CORRESPONDS TO THE OUTPUT ON THE LIGHTBOARD
I WILL SEND YOU THE PLUGBOARD CONFIGURATION FOLLOWED BY ALL THE LETTERS OF THE STATIC ROTOR IN CLOCKWISE ORDER 
PLEASE USE THEM TO ENCRYPT OR DECRYPT OUR FUTURE MESSAGES

TO_DO 
I want to actually combine the reflector logic here with the plugboard
Empasize that they are the same concept
Show that they form a loop or circuit
add pictures
