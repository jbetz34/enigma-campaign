I HAVE GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE ENCRYPTION MACHINE
AFTER MUCH EXPERIMENTATION I HAVE LEARNED THAT THE REMOVABLE ROTORS ARE ADDITIONAL LETTER SCRAMBLERS
SO FAR WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE PLUGBOARD AND THE REFLECTOR 
THESE MECHANISMS CREATE A MAPPING BETWEEN BETWEEN LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET
THIS ALLOWED FOR THIRTEEN DIFFERENT PAIRS OF LETTERS TO BE MAPPED AT THE SAME TIME
THESE MECHANISMS ARE ALSO UNIDIRECTIONAL
MEANING THAT DESPITE THE DIRECTION OF THE INPUT THE MESSAGE IS ALWAYS ENCRYPTED THE SAME
THE REMOVABLE ROTARIES USE A BIDIRECTIONAL MAPPING
EACH ROTOR HAS 2 DIFFERENT LETTER MAPPINGS ONE FOR EACH SIDE OF THE ROTOR
EACH LETTER PASSES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT THROUGH THE ROTARIES UNTIL IT REACHES THE REFLECTOR
THEN IT TURNS AROUND IN THE REFLECTOR AND GOES BACK THROUGH THE ROTARIES LEFT TO RIGHT
I HAVE A HELPFUL PICTURE TO EXPLAIN
I WILL SEND YOU THE LETTERS ON THE REFLECTOR FOLLOWED BY THE LETTERS ON THE ROTARY PLEASE USE THEM TO ENCRYPT OR DECRYPT OUR FUTURE MESSAGES
